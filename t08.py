# Code for T08: Practicing with Recursion
# Author: Patrick Shepherd

# This file gives you stubs for five recursive functions you must complete.

import os

# Function 1: Determine if an element is in a list.
def findme(item, thelist):
    """ Takes an integer, 'item', and searches for it in list 'thelist' recursively.
        Return True if item is in mylist, False otherwise.
    """
    pass
  
# Function 2: Determine the number of steps it takes to solve Tower of Hanoi with n rings.
def hanoi(n):
    """ Takes an integer n and returns the number of moves it would take to solve the
        Tower of Hanoi with n disks.
        Return an integer number of moves.
    """
    pass
  
# Function 3: Determine if a string is a palindrome.
def ispalindrome(thestring):
    """ Check if string 'thestring' is a palindrome.
        Return True if so, False otherwise.
    """
    pass
  
# Function 4: Pretty-print a directory tree on your computer
def printtree(f, prefix=''):
    """ Print a formatted version of a portion of the file system, starting at f.
        Function should print out a number of asterisks equal to the recursion
        depth.  When the function reahches a file, it should print the prefix
        and the filename.  If it is a folder, the program should print the folder's
        name and then recursively explore it.
    helpful functions:
      os.getcwd() returns the name of the current directory Python is looking in.
      os.listdir(directoryName) returns a list of the names of all files and folders
        found inside directoryName.  This can be an absolute path, or just the local
        name of a file in the current working directory.
      os.chdir(newDirectory) changes the current working directory to newDirectory.
        newDirectory can be an absolute path, or the name of a folder inside the
        current working directory.
        os.chdir('..') takes you back out to whatever folder contains the one you are
        currently in.
      os.isdir(name) returns True if name is the name of a folder, and false otherwise.

# Helper function for mergesort
def merge(lista, listb, listc):
    """ Merges 3 lists: lista, listb, listc
        returns a single merged list
    """
    pass

# Function 5: Implement MergeSort, but with a 3-way split instead of 2-way.
def mergesort(thelist):
    """ Sorts a list of numbers using a modified MergeSort algorithm
        returns the sorted list
    """
    pass
